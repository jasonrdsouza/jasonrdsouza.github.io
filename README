Note to self:

The themes are stored in a git submodule, but doing `git submodule update` will only bring them up to date with the latest submodule commit checked into master of *my* repo. In order to update the themes to their latest versions, you need to fetch the latest version from the upstream theme repo, and commit that version as follows:

```
cd themes
git pull origin master
cd ..
git add themes
git commit
```
