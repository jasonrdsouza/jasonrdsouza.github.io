Sometimes people ask me what my interests are. Frequently, I have a hard time answering that question. 
It's not that I don't have interests, it's more that I am not interested in keeping a list of my 
interests. Unfortunately, it makes me sound sort of boring when I can't tell people what I am 
interested in, so I decided to start this blog. Here I will write about things that interest me: 
articles I read, things I am learning to do, and sometimes, simply stream of consciousness about 
stuff I am thinking about.

The blog is more for me than for other people to read, but I hope some of the posts will be useful 
and informative for others. I have a few topics in mind to write about, and plan to keep the posts 
organized using labels, so people that care about certain topics may only read the relevantly labeled 
posts. Also, the frequency of these labels will ideally be a good indication of my "interests", and 
become the aforementioned interests list that I am so disinterested in. 

As to the content of the posts, some of the topics I plan on writing about include: wine, finance, 
cooking, religion, working out/ fitness, software/ programming, psychology, and new technology. 
Yea yea, I guess you could call that an interest list, but a stagnant non-comprehensive list 
doesn't do anyone's interests justice, and I am sure other topics will arise as I blog. 

For instance, to end this post, here is an interesting quote I read the other day told to graduating 
seniors at a commencement ceremony by one of my favorite authors:

> “There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet 
> an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says 
> "Morning, boys. How's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a 
> bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes 
> "What the hell is water?"
> ― David Foster Wallace
