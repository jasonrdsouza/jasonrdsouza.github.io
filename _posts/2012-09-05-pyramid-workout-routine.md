This workout should be done for 3 consecutive days, followed by 1 day of rest. 
Most exercises are done with pyramid sets. This means that you do 5 total sets for each. 
12 reps for the first set, 10 reps for the second, 8 for the third, 10 for the fourth, and 12 for the fifth. 
Start with a weight for each pyramid that allows you to do all the reps of every set, 
where you are failing on the last rep. So, for the first set, pick a weight W that allows you to do 
all 12 reps to failure on the last one. Then, for the second set, get a weight W + delta which allows 
you to do all 10 reps to failure on the last one. Likewise, for the third set choose a weight W + (delta * 2). 
Then, for the fourth set repeat what you did for the second set, and for the fifth set repeat what you 
did for the first set.


### Example

Pyramid Set of Incline Bench Press. In this case, W = 135, delta = 10.

- Set #1 (12 Reps @ 135 lbs)
- Set #2 (10 Reps @ 145 lbs)
- Set #3 (8 Reps @ 155 lbs)
- Set #4 (10 Reps @ 145 lbs)
- Set #5 (12 Reps @ 135 lbs)

- Sleep for at least 8 hours the night of a workout to give your body time to recover
- If you aren't sweating you probably aren't working hard enough
