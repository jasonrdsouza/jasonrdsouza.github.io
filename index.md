I am a technology enthusiast. I enjoy writing software, tinkering with computers, and staying up to date with the latest technology. 
I like to build things and solve problems. Specifically, I like to write software and experiment with technology. Computers have 
always fascinated me, and throughout my education, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of how they work, inside and out. 
I enjoy learning, and applying creative thinking to problems. An important part of learning, to me, is gaining a full, 
working knowledge of an area, which allows me to expand upon what I have learned, and apply it when appropriate. 
Coming up with clean, elegant, efficient solutions is always one of my goals. I am hardworking and motivated, as long as the work 
I am doing is interesting. Repetitive, boring tasks that require no thinking, problem solving, or creativity are typically a problem. 

I generally agree with these three rules:
1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.
2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.
3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.
