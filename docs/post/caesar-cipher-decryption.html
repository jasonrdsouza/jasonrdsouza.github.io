  <p>Recently, Google ran a <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GoogleforWork/posts/cftsomhu6H4">contest</a>
to promote their new <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/10/strengthening-2-step-verification-with.html">Security Key</a>.
The contest had 5 parts, each of which was a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>
challenge. They provided an encrypted message, and the first
100 people to submit the decrypted version of the message
received a security key for free. The puzzles provided an easy,
approachable example of the benefits of knowing how to program.
None of the puzzles were terribly difficult, and all could be
done manually in one fashion or another, but with a little
scripting knowledge, you could explain the puzzle to a computer,
and have it do most of the tedious work for you.</p>
<p>As an example, take puzzle #3:</p>
<p><img src="/static/posts/google-security-key-challenge-3.png" alt="Google Security Key Challenge #3" /></p>
<p>Accompanying this puzzle is the hint &quot;Caesar&quot;. At first, this text
looks like gibberish, but we know it is in fact
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext">ciphertext</a>. Armed
with our hint, we can begin trying to decode it.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-it-through">Thinking it Through</h3>
<p>With a little research, we come across something called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a>.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">cipher</a> is just a set
of instructions for how to encrypt/ decrypt data, and this
particular one is what is known as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">substitution cipher</a>.
Wikipedia does a good job explaining how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher,
Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely
known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in
which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed
number of positions down the alphabet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, to perform encryption via a caesar cipher, you pick a
number (<code>N</code>) and a direction (<code>D</code>), and shift each letter in
your input text by that many letters in the chosen direction.
In the example pictured below, the number is 3 (<code>N = 3</code>), and
the direction is Left (<code>D = &lt;-</code>), causing the input letter <code>E</code>
to be encrypted to the letter <code>B</code>. Notice also how the shifting
&quot;wraps around&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="/static/posts/caesar-cipher.png" alt="Caesar Cipher Example" /></p>
<p>This cipher seems like a pretty good candidate to decrypt our
ciphertext. Now, we just have to figure out what <code>N</code> and <code>D</code> are! First,
a few things to note. The ciphertext includes punctuation, which we are
going to assume is ignored by the cipher. It also includes both upper
and lower case letters, but we'll assume that the cipher is
case-insensitive. Finally, while the caesar cipher is defined in
terms of <code>N</code> and <code>D</code>, since the shifts &quot;wrap around&quot; (if you
have to shift past the last letter, you wrap around to the first
one), any <code>(N,D)</code> pair has an equivalent pair with it's
direction reversed.</p>
<p>More formally, for a given alphabet with <code>M</code> letters, a caesar
cipher defined by <code>(N = n, D = d)</code> is equivalent to the caesar
cipher defined by <code>(N = M - n, D = -d)</code>, keeping in mind that
for any <code>N</code>, <code>N == N % M</code>. If this is still unclear, I've found
drawing out a picture of equivalent ciphers with their directions
swapped to be illustrative.</p>
<p>Knowing that means we can drop <code>D</code> from our list of unknowns,
since there exists a correct value for <code>N</code> regardless of the
value of <code>D</code>! Furthermore, since we are dealing with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet">english alphabet</a> for
this particular puzzle, we know that there are only 26 possible
values for <code>N</code>. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_space_(cryptography)">key space</a>,
and all we have to do is try each key before 100 other people do,
to find the answer and win a prize! Unfortunately, doing that
manually is rather tedious. Now that we know how to solve the
problem, we need to write a script so that a computer can do
the boring part.</p>
<h3 id="scripting-and-decrypting">Scripting and Decrypting</h3>
<p>My current scripting language of choice is
<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, so I'll use that, but
the general concepts are the same regardless of language.</p>
<p>Lets start with the alphabet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ALPHABET = &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we need some way to represent the caesar cipher. We know
from earlier that the only initialization parameter the cipher
needs is <code>N</code>, and that it should take in a letter, and spit out
the encrypted form of that letter. We can represent the cipher
as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash map</a>, and
write a function that creates the cipher for a given value for <code>N</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">KEY_SPACE = len(ALPHABET)

def create_caesar_cipher(N):
  # we use the mod operator here to perform the wrap-around mentioned above
  cipher = {ALPHABET[i]: ALPHABET[(i+N) % KEY_SPACE] for i, _ in enumerate(ALPHABET)}
  return cipher
</code></pre>
<p>With this function to generate a cipher, we can now write a
decryption function that takes in ciphertext, runs it through
a given cipher, and outputs the decrypted text.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from string import punctuation

def decrypt(cipher, ciphertext):
  # remember we need to ignore letter case and punctuation
  decrypted = [letter if letter in punctuation + &quot; &quot; else cipher[letter] for letter in ciphertext.lower()]
  return &quot;&quot;.join(decrypted)
</code></pre>
<p>With those pieces in place, lets try to crack the code with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack">brute force</a>,
aka trying every possible combination. This is the same approach
we were going to take if we did it manually, but it makes sense
now because of how small this cipher's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_space_(cryptography)">key space</a>
is relative to the speed of our computer. (Remember that the key
space in this case is the amount of possible values for <code>N</code>,
which we determined earlier was 26).</p>
<p>The brute force approach can be accomplished like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">CIPHER_TEXT = &quot;Wuhdw brxu sdvvzrug olnh brxu wrrwkeuxvk. Grq'w ohw dqbergb hovh xvh lw, dqg jhw d qhz rqh hyhub vla prqwkv. Foliirug Vwroo&quot;

for n in range(KEY_SPACE):
  cipher = create_caesar_cipher(n)
  plaintext = decrypt(cipher, CIPHER_TEXT)
  print(&quot;{}:\t{}&quot;.format(n, plaintext))
</code></pre>
<p>After running that code, all that's left to do is read through each of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext">plaintext</a> entries,
and find the one that makes sense. Here's the output I get... can
you spot the correctly decrypted value?</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>Writing software is fundamentally about teaching computers to
solve problems for you, and this cryptography challenge is a
quintessential example of how useful a little knowledge of
programming can be. We took a &quot;real world&quot; problem, came up with
an approach to solve it, and implemented that approach in a few
lines of code. Obviously the cryptographic methods used
in this case are toy examples, and the solution is fairly
trivial, but the underlying techniques are useful nonetheless.</p>
