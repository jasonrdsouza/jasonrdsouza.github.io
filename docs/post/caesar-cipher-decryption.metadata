Lots of software engineering deals with large programs, and high level architectural challenges. This post explores the other side of programming... small, one-of scripts designed to solve a specific problem. I'll walk through how I solved a small cryptographic puzzle posed online, and try to explain the process of problem solving via code at a micro-level.","url":"/post/caesar-cipher-decryption.html"}
