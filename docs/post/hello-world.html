<h1>Hello World</h1>

<main>
  <p>Sometimes people ask me what my interests are. Frequently, I have a hard time answering that question.
It's not that I don't have interests, I simply find it uninteresting to keep a list of my
interests. Unfortunately, that makes me sound sort of boring, so I decided to start this blog. Here I will write about things that interest me:
articles I read, skills I am learning, and sometimes, simply stream of consciousness.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def print_greeting
    print("Hello World")

print_greeting
#=&gt; "Hello World"
</code></pre>
<p>The blog is mainly for me, but I hope some of the posts will be useful
and informative to others. I have a few topics in mind to write about, and plan to keep the posts
organized using labels, so people that only care about certain topics may tailor their consumption accordingly.
The frequency of these labels will ideally serve as a dynamic indication of my "interests", and
become the aforementioned interests list that I am so disinterested in.</p>
<p>To end this post, and initiate the digitization of my interests,
here is a quote by one of my favorite writers, told to graduating
seniors at a commencement ceremony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet
an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says
"Morning, boys. How's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a
bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes
"What the hell is water?"
â€• David Foster Wallace</p>
