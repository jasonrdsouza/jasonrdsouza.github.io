<h1>About Me</h1>

<main>
  <p>I am a technology enthusiast.
I enjoy writing software, tinkering with computers, and staying up to date with the latest technology.</p>
<p>I like to build things and solve problems.
Specifically, I like to write software and experiment with technology.
Computers have always fascinated me, and throughout my education,
I have gained a comprehensive understanding of how they work, inside and out.</p>
<p>I enjoy learning, and applying creative thinking to problems.
An important part of learning, to me, is gaining a full, working knowledge of an area,
which allows me to expand upon what I have learned, and apply it when appropriate.</p>
<p>Coming up with clean, elegant, efficient solutions is always one of my goals.
I am hardworking and motivated as long as the work I am doing is interesting.</p>
