I am a technology enthusiast.
I enjoy writing software, tinkering with computers, and staying up to date with the latest technology.

I like to build things and solve problems.
Specifically, I like to write software and experiment with technology.
Computers have always fascinated me, and throughout my education,
I have gained a comprehensive understanding of how they work, inside and out.

I enjoy learning, and applying creative thinking to problems.
An important part of learning, to me, is gaining a full, working knowledge of an area,
which allows me to expand upon what I have learned, and apply it when appropriate.

Coming up with clean, elegant, efficient solutions is always one of my goals.
I am hardworking and motivated as long as the work I am doing is interesting.
